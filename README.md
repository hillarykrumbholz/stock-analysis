# Stock-Analysis

Stock analysis through use of VBA

### Challenge

With this analysis the goal was to look at stock data across multiple years (2017 and 2018) and to create a macro that would determine total volume, starting and ending price and the percentage of return for each stock (12 stocks that we had data for). With the challenge we wanted to refactor the code so that it runs more quickly and is easier to understand. In order to accomplish this, the nested for loops were removed, and a macro for a 'Run' and 'Clear' button was created and inserted into the sheet. Additionally, conditional formatting was added so the either positive or negative returns could be easily identified. Lastly, we designed the macro so that data from either the 2017 or 2018 year could be looked at. With the refactoring of this macro, we could easily apply this to additional year and to a larger set of stock data.
